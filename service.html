              <p>It’s simple. Your website should be easy to find, easy to use, easy to update, easy on the eye and, most importantly, easy for your customers to do business with.
                Our web designers craft beautiful, effective, user-centric websites.
                 Our creative team craft appealing and distinctive sites with clear messaging to engage your visitors. We know exactly how to strike the balance between visual beauty and usability while never losing focus on delivering on your strategic business goals.<br>
                  Each and every site we create is unique, carefully handcrafted to match the needs of your particular audience, and clearly conveys the nuances of your brand. To do that, we don't start with Photoshop as most others do, we start with a brand survey that gets to know you, your differentiators, how you stack up against your competitors, and a clear understanding your particular audience. The result is a website that is on-message, simple for your visitors to understand, and intentionally targeted to convert your audience. This customized approach ensures your site isn't just a necessary expense but becomes an investment that drives a visible return for your business – you can't get that value from an off-the-shelf template.

            <p>Laravel is a fast paced PHP based framework popular for delivering simple and user friendly
            web architecture enhanced with an intuitive design and a whole array of powerful tools. Swift web development with simple architecture and powerful coding is the strength of Laravel.
            We at Mandala IT Solutions build an array of sophisticated, feature rich and dynamic web apps powered by Laravel. We unleash the power of Laravel in delivering simplicity, ease of use and dynamic user experience in the web apps we build.
            We give exceptional priority to ease of use while never undermining the importance of powerful features in web experience. This is precisely why we prefer Laravel with its simple architecture and rich set of tools. With Laravel we build robust, feature rich websites that are exceptionally easy to use.

            <p>Enterprise systems are sophisticated web applications that prioritize security, scalability, and data protection. Designing an enterprise system requires taking your challenge and creating a system that integrates and accounts for all of its interrelated aspects. 

            Taking the ideas gathered through consultation and research, our team applies them strategically. Designers utilize the initial concepts to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes, and our developers integrate with what you already have, using cutting edge technology to ground your application and make it secure, scalable, and protected.
            We utilize testing rigor to create an efficient and secure system. Our designers and developers spend time putting together a plan and then actualize it with research, design, and extensive usability testing. We focus on making our code work, and we’re certain that our developers expertly create scalable enterprise systems that rest on a firm, secure foundation.

            So If you are planning to register your domain name than please email us or call us.
            We also help you to register .np domain for free of cost.

            Besides Domain Registration, we also provide the services of Domain Renewal.
            Domain Renewal is a process that occurs at the end of your billing every year you must renew your domain registration. We will send you a reminder email and invoice before your renewal date. If your domain invoice goes unpaid, your domain could go up for sale again.
            If you do not pay the domain name renewal, you will also lose access to your website.
 
            Moreover, if you bought your domain somewhere else you have the options to transfer the domain to us or change the Name Servers or DNS to point to our servers.
